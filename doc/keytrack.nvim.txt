Keytrack.nvim is a plugin made to help you keep track of how many times you use
a command/keymap. Most likely if a command you’re tracking has low usage, you
can remap it or delete it to simplify your neovim config.

WHY                                                        *keytrack.nvim-why*

1. You’re most likely a beginner or a long time Neovim user and wants to clean up their keymaps.
2. Track keymap to see how often you use them.

Mainly built to track how often I use my keymaps. In the end, I want to either
delete or remap certain keymaps that I don’t use often.


INSTALLATION                                      *keytrack.nvim-installation*

BASIC SETUP                                        *keytrack.nvim-basic-setup*

Currently, you have to opt-in for each keymap you want to track.

>lua
    {
        "dougrocha/keytrack.nvim",
        dependencies = {
            "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
        }
        opts = {
          active = {
            { key = "<leader>a", desc = "Add harpoon file" },
            { key = "<leader>sf", desc = "Search Files with telescope" },
          },
          --- (Optional) Adds a suffix to the command description so you know it's being tracked
          suffix = "(Tracked)"
        },
    }
